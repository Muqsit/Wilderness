# Wilderness v0.0.1 configuration

# Sets coordinate ranges /wild should be bounded to.
# range = [min, max] (closed interval)
# Use centerx, centerz and blockedradius to block players from /wilding
# to a position in the predefined area. This can be useful for a warzone
# where players are not meant to /wild into.
coordinate-ranges:
  minx: -10000
  maxx: 10000
  minz: -10000

# Whether to temporarily lock players off of using the command
# while a /wild request is pending.
# When a player executes /wild, they are most likely going to request
# the server to load (or even generate a whole new) chunk. While the
# chunk is loading/generating, the /wild request would be pending.
# It is RECOMMENDED you set this option to true to disallow players from
# stacking up wilderness requests and flooding the server with chunk
# load/generate requests.

# Whether to use pocketmine's Level::getSafeSpawn() algorithm while teleporting
# players in the wilderness.
# This prevents players from getting teleported to places where they would
# instead have suffocated, such as a 1x1x1 gap.
